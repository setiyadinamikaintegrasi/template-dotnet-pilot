# ADR-0007: Define a component-aware monorepo CI contract

- **Status:** Accepted — implemented; blocking adoption deferred
- **Date:** 2026-08-09
- **Decision owners:** Template maintainers and consumer project owners

## Context

ADR-0006 introduced an explicit `monorepo` layout declaration and deliberately
made `scripts/detect-stack.sh` return `unknown` until nested CI behavior was
designed. A monorepo can contain several independent stacks, for example a Go
service under `src/backend` and a Node.js application under `src/frontend`.
Selecting the first nested manifest is not deterministic and can produce a
false-green or false-red result.

The current reusable workflows are single-stack workflows. Enabling nested
execution without a contract would also make artifact names, required check
contexts, path filtering, fork behavior, and branch-protection migration
ambiguous.

The MangaHub consumer pilot validated the component contract: its Go backend
and React frontend required explicit working directories, a consumer-owned
bridge while the template remained `unknown`, and no root-level manifest
symlink. A second `media-belajar-anak` pilot exercised the version-2 dispatcher
on GitHub-hosted runners. It exposed a caller/callee concurrency collision, a
missing Go linter installation, and false failures when optional Node.js test
categories were empty. This ADR now includes those runtime boundaries;
version-1 consumers remain unchanged while the version-2 aggregate check stays
advisory pending consumer-specific governance approval.

## Decision

Implement component-aware CI only through the following explicit contract,
validated against the MangaHub diagnostic pilot and the `media-belajar-anak`
hosted-runner pilot.

### 1. Explicit component manifest

Version 2 of the `.template/project.yaml` contract lists components explicitly;
the resolver validates the list rather than recursively discovering manifests:

```yaml
version: 2
layout: monorepo
primary_stack: auto
primary_path: src/backend
components:
  - id: backend
    path: src/backend
    stack: go
    required: true
    artifact: backend
  - id: frontend
    path: src/frontend
    stack: node
    required: true
    artifact: frontend
```

Component `id` values are unique, path values are safe repository-relative
directories, and `stack` values use the existing supported vocabulary. A
component must be explicitly listed; an unlisted nested manifest is not
implicitly built. Version 1 remains valid and continues the current
single-stack/`unknown` compatibility behavior.

### 2. Component fan-out and working directory

`ci-monorepo.yml` fans out from the validated component list. Each matrix job
runs the existing stack tools with the component path as its working directory
and receives only the configuration needed for that component. The root
single-stack mapper remains unchanged; the workflow provides the path boundary
through GitHub Actions defaults rather than changing root detection implicitly.

Unsupported or invalid required components fail configuration validation before
tool execution. Optional components may be marked advisory only after the
consumer defines what “optional” means and how aggregate status is reported.

### 3. Stable checks and aggregation

Every monorepo run creates one stable aggregate check, even when no component
path changed. Component checks use deterministic names derived from the
validated component id, for example:

```text
monorepo / aggregate
monorepo / quality / backend
monorepo / test / backend
monorepo / build / backend
```

The aggregate check reports skipped components explicitly and is the only
candidate for a new branch-protection requirement. Component contexts are
advisory until a consumer pilot proves that matrix names remain stable across
forks, reruns, and component additions. Existing required contexts are not
renamed as part of this work.

### 4. Artifacts and promotion

Each component owns an artifact named with its validated id, such as
`build-backend` or `build-frontend`. Artifact metadata includes the source
commit, component id, path, and stack. Deployment, if later adopted, promotes
the exact validated artifact; it does not rebuild a component for production.

### 5. Paths, cost, and no-op behavior

Path-aware execution may skip unaffected component jobs, but it must not use a
path filter that suppresses the aggregate required check. Shared files,
workflow changes, and dependency/configuration changes conservatively fan out
to all required components. The consumer pilot must measure matrix size,
runtime, duplicate work, and check noise before enabling blocking behavior.

### 6. Security and fork behavior

Component-aware workflows retain `pull_request` fork safety, immutable Action
SHAs, least-privilege permissions, and no provider or deployment secrets in
untrusted pull-request jobs. `pull_request_target` is not an implementation
shortcut. Artifact uploads and comments must use the existing trusted handoff
patterns where write permissions are required.

### 7. Reusable-workflow runtime boundaries

The event-facing `ci.yml` dispatcher owns top-level cancellation. Every called
workflow uses a workflow-specific concurrency-group suffix because GitHub
passes the caller's `github.workflow` value into a reusable workflow; sharing
the caller group can cancel the dispatcher before component fan-out appears.

Go quality jobs install `golangci-lint` at an explicit version through an
immutable Action SHA before invoking the existing mapper command. Node.js unit
tests remain required. Integration and end-to-end categories run when matching
Vitest files exist and otherwise report an explicit successful skip; a real
Vitest failure continues to fail the component job.

## Validation evidence

On 2026-08-09, the `media-belajar-anak` consumer PR passed the corrected generic
dispatcher twice without a consumer-owned caller:

- [run 31312862775](https://github.com/setiyadinamikaintegrasi/media-belajar-anak/actions/runs/31312862775);
- [run 31313000802](https://github.com/setiyadinamikaintegrasi/media-belajar-anak/actions/runs/31313000802).

Both runs produced the resolver, deterministic backend/frontend quality, test,
and build contexts, and the stable `monorepo / aggregate` result. Required
security and documentation checks also passed. This evidence closes the hosted
runtime-validation step; it does not validate fork behavior, a larger matrix,
deployment artifact promotion, or consumer branch-protection migration.

## Alternatives considered

### Recursively select the first manifest

Rejected. Ordering is not a component contract and mixed stacks can be
misclassified.

### Run one root workflow for every nested stack

Rejected. The current mapper assumes a single working directory, and a root
workflow would obscure ownership, artifact boundaries, and failure attribution.

### Duplicate workflows per component

Rejected. Duplication would drift security permissions, Action pins, check
names, and fixes. Reusable workflows with validated matrix inputs are the
preferred direction.

### Apply path filters to required workflows

Rejected. A filtered-out workflow can leave branch-protection contexts pending
or absent. Aggregation must remain visible on every relevant pull request.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Nested stacks are explicit, reviewable, and attributable to a component.
- Required checks and artifacts can be governed without guessing.
- Existing single-stack consumers retain their current behavior.
- Runtime and provider choices remain consumer-owned.

Trade-offs:

- The single-stack detector remains `unknown` for declared monorepos; validated
  version-2 configurations are routed through component-aware CI instead.
- Consumer setup requires explicit component metadata rather than discovery.
- Matrix CI can increase runtime and cost; a pilot must establish limits.

## Security implications

The proposal preserves fork-safe triggers, least privilege, SHA-pinned Actions,
and human-controlled production. Component paths and ids are validated before
they reach working-directory or artifact commands. No secrets are introduced
into the project manifest.

## Data implications

No application data or customer payloads are added. CI metadata may include
component ids, paths, commit identifiers, and artifact names; consumers must
avoid putting sensitive data in those fields.

## Operational implications

The implementation must publish an aggregate result, bounded matrix size,
component-level logs, artifact retention policy, and a rollback path to the
current single-stack behavior. Required check contexts must be recorded in the
consumer's branch-protection plan before activation.

## Migration strategy

1. Keep version-1 configs and no-config repositories unchanged.
2. Validate this contract against the MangaHub consumer pilot.
3. Keep version-2 schema validation and component workflow support covered by
   the resolver and workflow contract tests.
4. Run component checks advisory-only and measure cost, noise, and stability
   on a consumer pilot.
5. Completed 2026-08-09: the corrected dispatcher, Go lint setup, optional
   Node.js categories, and aggregate result passed twice on consumer PR #1.
6. Add the aggregate check to branch protection only after a human-approved
   migration plan and stable check evidence.

## Rollback considerations

Disable component-aware fan-out and return declared monorepos to `unknown` if
check names drift, artifacts are ambiguous, fork safety regresses, or CI cost
exceeds the approved limit. Do not silently fall back to the first nested
manifest.
